Different intelligent models are made using Deep Learning approache for Classification and Regression problems. All the models are tested on test data and acceptable accuracy is achieved. Number recognition problem is experimented on MNIST dataset using two approaches Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).
